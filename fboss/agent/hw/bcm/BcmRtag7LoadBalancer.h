/* The BcmRtag7LoadBalancer singleton manages the RTAG7 load-balancing engine.
 *
 * It is responsible for allocating the resources of this engine so as to
 * achieve the load-balancing requirements of SwitchState's LoadBalancerTable
 * (or report that the configuration is not possible to implement).
 *
 * Presently, BcmRtag7LoaBalancer leverages the following facts to perform a
 * a trivial resource allocation:
 *
 * - Configuration constrains the maximum number of LoadBalancers that may exist
 *   in the system to two (ECMP and LAG).
 * - The RTAG7 engine exposes _two_ identical load-balancing modules that can be
 *   programmed independently of one another.
 *
 * RTAG7 resource allocation is then performed by dedicating one module to ECMP
 * and the other to LAG. In this way, all load-balancing configurations are
 * permissible.
 *
 * If a third load-balancing point is added in the future, this class would
 * have to be extended to share one of the two modules between two
 * load-balancers.
