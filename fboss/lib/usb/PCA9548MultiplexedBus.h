// a) multiplexers are at contigous addresses,
// b) QSFPs are ordered w.r.t to multiplexers, so QSFP 1-8 go to
// multiplexer 1, 9-16 go to multplexer 2  and so on
// This is true on the platforms we have. If things change its
// easy to adapt this class to take a mapping of multiplexer
// addresses and QSFP to multiplexer mapping and work off that.
